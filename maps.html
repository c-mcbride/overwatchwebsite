                    <p class="map-text">The Antarctica Peninsula arrived in Overwatch 2 season 3, and is the latest control map to launch
                        in the multiplayer game. This frosty landscape is the research base of peerless climatologist and
                        enduring optimist Mei, and features a stunning aurora australis and free-roaming penguins.
                        Given its theme, it certainly feels like an extension of the Ecopoint: Antarctica arena map that
                        typically serves as the stage for the Overwatch Winter Wonderland events. However, the focal point
                        for players fighting within the Antarctica Peninsula will undoubtedly be the enormous bow of the
                        icebreaker ship, though we can also expect to duke it out in ice caves and underground industrial
                        warehouses.

                            only safe haven for displaced Omnics, sequestered in the Himalayas far from human civilization.
                            At one point or another, it’s served as the home for Zenyatta, Genji, and Ramattra,
                            among many other synthetic fugitives fleeing the Omnic Crisis. The Escort mission will take
                            players along its winding paths, following in the footsteps of the Omnics before you.

                            It’s quite enclosed compared to other Overwatch 2 maps, with courtyard gardens and small cafes,
                            so expect some gladiator-style fighting and exquisite architecture. The best Overwatch 2 tank
